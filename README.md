# OpenGL Cascades Demo
This project was an assignment for my university. It does **NOT** contain usable code and is only a proof of concept!

## Content
This demo is inspired by the "Cascades" demo by Nvidia and has a lot of different graphic-related stuff in it. Some parts are in C++ but the most are in GLSL.
- marching cubes
- transform feedback
- simple shadow mapping(hard, soft and pcss)
- displacement mapping (via uv-manipulation and/or tessellation)
- tri-planar texture mapping
- a simple particle simulation calculated with a vertex shader (used like a compute shader)
- probably more, I can't remember...
